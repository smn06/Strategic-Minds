#### Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Game Mastery**: Train an AI agent to achieve expert-level performance in challenging and dynamic games such as Dota 2 and StarCraft II.

2. **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Implement state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning techniques to enable the AI to learn and adapt to various in-game scenarios.

3. **OpenAI Gym Integration**: Connect the AI agent with OpenAI Gym environments tailored for Dota 2 and StarCraft II, providing a standardized interface for training and evaluation.

4. **Community Collaboration**: Foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing within the AI and gaming communities. Encourage contributors to explore and enhance the project.
